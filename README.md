# Counter

## 🎮 About the Project
This project implements a counter with multiple buttons to manipulate the count. The `Add 1` and `Add 100` buttons increase the counter by 1 and 100 respectively. Additionally, the `Increase` button works as follows:
- It adds 1 to the count.
- If the new count is divisible by 5, it adds an additional 100.

This behavior creates a dynamic and interactive counter system.
